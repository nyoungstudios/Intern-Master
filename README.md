Intern Master. Considered your internship application done :)

# What is Intern Master?
There is a need for automated service to apply for internships. Because the internship applications forms are highly repetitive: each company has its own application system and the candidates must use that specific system to apply for a position. Most of the things on these forms are the same: first name, last name, school, graduation date, skills, projects, experiences, ethnicity, disabilities, gender, etc. Although sometimes the auto completion in Google Chrome or Apple Safari will do the magic for you, but the result is so minimal and uneffective. Many students find themselves copying and pasting when filling these forms. We think that an automated system with a smart ‘brain’ that would find and apply to intern positions would save students from physical labor and mental stress.
