# Intern-Master
Intern Master. Considered your internship application done :)

# IMPORTANT
This is not the original working repository. The original working repository was private, but I have copied the contents (execuding the authentication and api keys) so that anyone can take a look at my code. I wrote on all the code for the backend. I made about half of the 271 total commits to the original repository over the course of four months (January to April 2018).
